# Yup. I said it. Shoot me now.

Certain shit gets the_Boogie Man_treatment: the things, or rather "J-E-L-L-O," that go bump in the wee hours of the night; the things we as a community want to sweep under the rug, or ignore.

One of the main reasons I applied and eventually went to Temple University was because I assumed it was Bill Cosby's Hillman. I assumed that I too would be able to live in his legacy because, who didn't want to be Bill Cosby growing up? The real question was who didn't want to be the fictional character Heathcliff Huxtable on the fictional television show_The Cosby Show_, played by Bill Cosby, growing up?

_Look at dem' sweaters, y'all._

Come on. His niece and nephew were named Winnie and Nelson. The jazz records and guest stars modeled pure Black excellence. His wife was Phylicia Rashad for God's sake.

Then Hannibal Buress opened his big mouth and the earth cracked: Cosby? Pillar of our hopes and dreams Cosby? Drugging women and having sex with them?

_Nah, say it ain't so_.

So we did. We opted for the less dangerous. Because we know the story. We know the Paul Robesons, the Sammy Davises and Sam Cookes. Play by the rules of the White infrastructure or be held captive by the rings of marginal success, because for all of Sammy's glory and genius, he will still be considered by many to be just another Sinatra lackey.
